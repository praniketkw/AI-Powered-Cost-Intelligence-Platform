# AI-Powered Cost Intelligence Platform

An enterprise-grade cost intelligence platform that correlates cloud spending with performance metrics, business context, and operational events to provide proactive, actionable cost insights. Think "DataDog for Cost Intelligence" with AI-powered root cause analysis.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform solves the #1 problem in enterprise cloud management: **reactive cost discovery**. Instead of finding out about cost issues after they happen, our AI-powered system provides:

- **Proactive Cost Intelligence**: Predict cost issues before they impact budgets
- **Contextual Correlation**: Link cost spikes to deployments, incidents, and business events
- **Intelligent Alerting**: AI-filtered alerts that focus on actionable issues, not noise
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Bridge the gap between Finance, Engineering, and Business teams
- **Real-Time Root Cause Analysis**: Instantly understand why costs changed and what to do about it

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude for cost analysis and recommendations
- **MCP Servers**: Custom servers for Azure cost data, analysis, and recommendations
- **Data Simulation**: Realistic enterprise-scale cost patterns and usage metrics

## 🚀 Key Features

**Proactive Cost Intelligence**
- AI-powered cost spike prediction (detect issues 2-4 hours before they impact budgets)
- Intelligent anomaly detection with business context and root cause analysis
- Predictive budget burn rate with confidence intervals

**Contextual Correlation Engine**
- Correlate cost changes with deployments, incidents, and performance metrics
- Link resource scaling events to business metrics (user growth, feature launches)
- Map cost impacts to specific teams, projects, and business initiatives

**Intelligent Alerting & Workflows**
- AI-filtered alerts that eliminate 90% of false positives
- Automated incident response workflows with suggested remediation
- Cross-team collaboration tools with cost impact context

**Real-Time Business Intelligence**
- Live cost attribution to business features and customer segments
- ROI analysis for infrastructure investments
- Executive dashboards with business-relevant cost insights

## 📊 Simulated Enterprise Scale

- 200+ Azure subscriptions across engineering teams
- $15M+ annual cloud spend
- 50,000+ resources across 12 global regions
- Realistic usage patterns for high-scale SaaS platform
- Multi-environment deployments (dev, staging, prod)
- Microservices architecture with container orchestration

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **MCP Integration**: Custom servers for cost data and AI analysis
- **AI/ML**: Time series forecasting, anomaly detection, NLP for recommendations
- **Enterprise Features**: Multi-tenant architecture, RBAC, audit logging
